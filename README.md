###### Measure length, not inches. Measure weight, not ounces.

* *The primitive condition of mankind is FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY (BARTER ECONOMY).*

* *By definition, no one ever changed the amount of money in the world, people decide what a standard of value is worth, not how much there is.*

***Evict*** measured money, NOT TENANTS (not VALUE!).

***Foreclose*** against measured money, NOT AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OWN HOUSES (not against VALUE!).


#  ***Real stimulus***

 is measuring length and weight, not inches, ounces, or dollars. ***Measuring DEFINED inches, ounces, or dollars is impossible,*** they invariably serve their default purpose of measurement. ***Announcing UNDEFINED inches, ounces, and dollars would immediately fail.*** So, ***UNDEFINED DOLLARS, DOLLARS WITH NO ID, AREN'T ANNOUNCED, THEY'RE SAID TO BE MEASURED.***



***Distorting value, conferring undeserved value, is all that measured money (dollars with no ID) does.***



Without measured money, ***the distorted value of housing would end, EVICTIONS, FORECLOSURES, AND HOMELESS PEOPLE COULD NEVER BE ISSUES.***



The gold standard is ***no issue of the amount of money, it's the issue of ENDING DISTORTED VALUES.***



***Real stimulus is the whole idea of a money economy,*** its great advantage over the primitive condition of financial complexity (barter economy), ***MEASURING VALUE, NOT THE HOAX (FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY) OF MEASURING A STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT.***



> ***Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*** means no access to standards of measurement? ***Inalienable rights*** require an ID? A photo ID to use an ***UNDEFINED INCH OR OUNCE (INCH OR OUNCE WITHOUT AN ID)?*** A photo ID to make measurements?  ***Gold dollars attract a zillion times more private property (VALUE) to market, a zillion times more VALUE to measure, a zillion times more scrutiny of the dollar (money trail). HOUSES STAY HOME!!!, houses and their occupants are safe!!!***

> ***GOLD DOLLARS ARE FOR REWARDING PEOPLE, NOT FOR DISRUPTING PEOPLE, NOT FOR WASTING RESOURCES, NOT FOR SQUANDERING ON HOUSES!!!*** 

> ***Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*** means disrupt housing?

* *By definition, no one ever changed the amount of money in the world, people decide what a MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE is worth, not how much there is.*


# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR***

***Without an ID, the DOLLAR IS HOMELESS, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. DISTORTED VALUE IS HOMELESS!, houses and their occupants are NO LONGER SAFE!
 HOMELESS HOUSES AND HOMELESS PEOPLE!!!***

***Distorted value, HOMELESS DOLLARS, CAUSES HOMELESS HOUSES AND HOMELESS PEOPLE!!!***

* *Real stimulus is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.*

# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR. Part 2***

Without an ID, the dollar is homeless, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. ***Nor as measured money either. The measuring of money is conducted entirely as a very deep subject which even the experts can never agree upon. PRICE HAGGLING AT ITS WORST!!!, NO AGREEMENT EVER REACHED!!! The Federal Reserve has never even duplicated BUYING GROCERIES WITH A COW!, where at least a real transaction takes place. BUYING AND SELLING can't work for dollars with no ID, for measuring money. People and houses are safe, no turmoil, no distractions, nowhere for ID-less dollars to hide. BORROWING AND LENDING, and CHARITY, is the only way, transactions abandoned, replaced with distracted captive audiences, only an endless quest for accomplices, for more people to pass the buck to.***

# ***LA MONEDA NUEVA***

***An ordinary fellow with some first-hand knowledge of Argentina's "Moneda Nueva" ("New Money") once put it like so: "When the "Moneda Nueva" comes out, they change the number of zeroes and move the decimal point around."***

# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR. Part 3***

***Without an ID, the dollar is <ins>homeless, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. Nor as measured money either.</ins> The measuring of money is conducted entirely as a <ins>CONSPIRACY!!!</ins>***


## Measuring value is ***<ins>MEASURING HUMAN LABOR</ins>, nothing can be more important, no product of human labor, <ins>NO HOUSE</ins> can be more important, LET ALONE <ins>LAND, NO PRODUCT OF HUMAN LABOR AT  ALL. Measuring value, houses naturally fall into place BEHIND people, are their servants and creations, not their oppressors.</ins>*** 

> ***Gold in their pockets, paper on their walls***

   > "Never, indeed, was there a time in which so much gold was employed decoratively as in this age when ***coined gold was almost unprocurable, and paper money had been put into circulation to supply the lack.*** It was a saying of Andr√©-Louis' that if these people could only have been induced to ***PUT THE PAPER ON THEIR WALLS AND THE GOLD INTO THEIR POCKETS, THE FINANCES OF THE KINGDOM MIGHT SOON HAVE BEEN IN BETTER CASE."***       *- Rafael Sabatini, <ins>Scaramouche</ins>, Book Three, Chapter 4. At Meudon. 1921*

 > ***Money was never so hard to be come at ...***

   > ***The swindler*** "entertained me with a pathetic harangue on ***the great scarcity of silver***, which I undertook to improve, by deploring also ***the great scarcity of gold;*** and by the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that ***money was never so hard to be come at*** as now."    *- Oliver Goldsmith, <ins>The Vicar of Wakefield</ins>, 1766. Chapter 14.*

# ***The environmental movement explained***

***Worrying about the amount of money in the world is of NO VALUE (pure WASTE OF RESOURCES). The obsession of governments worldwide with the amount of money is the ENTIRE EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT.***

# ***Saving the earth (THE HOMELESS EARTH)***

***When nobody's interfering with the LAND UNDER YOUR FEET, that piece of ground gets the best care it can get - UNLESS YOU'RE SAVING THE EARTH!!!***

***Saving the earth means ABANDONING THE LAND UNDER YOUR OWN FEET FOR THE LAND UNDER EVERYBODY'S FEET, forgetting SPECIALIZATION, focusing on MINDING EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS BUT YOUR OWN, pure waste of resources, the land under your own feet <ins>completely neglected, HOMELESS</ins>, <ins>the earth taking it on the chin, HOMELESS</ins>, commerce <ins>killed</ins>, prosperity <ins>killed</ins>, returning barbarism.***

# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR. Part 4***

***No one will take personal responsibility FOR CHALLENGING THE DICTIONARY!!! People decide what a standard of value is worth, not how much there is.***

# ***The SAFE HAVEN of money measurers. TILTING AT WINDMILLS, crusading against the smokescreen. Laundering measured money. Nothing but BOGUS PRICES.***

***No one will take personal responsibility for challenging the dictionary, so the money measurers TAKE IT FOR GRANTED clamoring for the RIGHT AMOUNT!!! of their dollars with no ID, ANY AMOUNT GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT ROBBERY AND BOGUS PRICES!!! The entire subject of inflation and deflation (the right amount) is WINDMILLS AND SMOKESCREEN, THERE IS NO RIGHT AMOUNT OF ROBBERY AND BOGUS PRICES AND HOMELESS DOLLARS!!!***

# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR. Part 5. Measure THE SAFETY OF HOUSES, not money.***

***Gold and silver are never homeless, everyone will take personal responsibility for them, never change the amount of money in the world or otherwise change the subject or defy the dictionary, always measure THE SAFETY OF HOUSES, the safer the house the more SPE
CIALIZATION (VALUE) takes place, the more private property (VALUE) comes to market. A STANDARD OF VALUE is a STANDARD OF THE SAFETY OF HOUSES.***

# ***THE HOMELESS (PHOTO ID-POWERED) DOLLAR. Part 6. No substitute for PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY-POWERED dollars.***

***All the money measurers have photo IDs, none will take personal responsibility 
for what they do, issuing ID-less dollars. Only 
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY (VALUE!!!) circulates gold dollars, not photo IDs. Measure personal responsibility (VALUE!!!, HOUSE SAFETY!!!), not money.***

# ***THE HOMELESS (WITHOUT NATURAL LAW) DOLLAR. Part 7. LAWS AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A HOME***

***The judicial branch of government stands for NATURAL LAW (law with a home; personal responsibility, private property), as opposed to man-made law, which may, as with money measuring laws, be HOMELESS, DEFY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PRIVATE PROPERTY. But the judicial branch STANDS FOR NOTHING when it STANDS SILENT, as with the money measuring laws.***
