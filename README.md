###### Measure length, not inches. Measure weight, not ounces.

* *The primitive condition of mankind is FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY (BARTER ECONOMY).*

* *By definition, no one ever changed the amount of money in the world, people decide what a standard of value is worth, not how much there is.*

Evict measured money, NOT TENANTS (not VALUE!).

Foreclose against measured money, NOT AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OWN HOUSES (not against VALUE!).


#  ***Real stimulus***

 is measuring length and weight, not inches, ounces, or dollars. ***Measuring DEFINED inches, ounces, or dollars is impossible,*** they invariably serve their default purpose of measurement. ***Announcing UNDEFINED inches, ounces, and dollars would immediately fail.*** So, ***UNDEFINED DOLLARS, DOLLARS WITH NO ID, AREN'T ANNOUNCED, THEY'RE SAID TO BE MEASURED.***



***Distorting value, conferring undeserved value, is all that measured money (dollars with no ID) does.***



Without measured money, ***the distorted value of housing would end, EVICTIONS, FORECLOSURES, AND HOMELESS PEOPLE COULD NEVER BE ISSUES.***



The gold standard is ***no issue of the amount of money, it's the issue of ENDING DISTORTED VALUES.***



***Real stimulus is the whole idea of a money economy,*** its great advantage over the primitive condition of financial complexity (barter economy), ***MEASURING VALUE, NOT THE HOAX (FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY) OF MEASURING A STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT.***



> ***Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*** means no access to standards of measurement? ***Inalienable rights*** require an ID? A photo ID to use an ***INCH OR OUNCE WITHOUT AN ID?*** A photo ID to make measurements?  ***Gold dollars attract a zillion times more private property (value) to market, a zillion times more value to measure, a zillion times more scrutiny of the dollar (money trail). HOUSES STAY HOME!!! GOLD DOLLARS ARE FOR REWARDING PEOPLE, NOT FOR DISRUPTING PEOPLE, NOT FOR WASTING RESOURCES, NOT FOR SQUANDERING ON HOUSES!!!*** 

> ***Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*** means disrupt housing?
