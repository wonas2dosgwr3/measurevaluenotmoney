# **measurevaluenotmoney/Sound money/Real stimulus**

###### Measure length, not inches. Measure weight, not ounces.

* *The primitive condition of mankind is FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY (BARTER ECONOMY).*

* *By definition, no one ever changed the amount of money in the world, people decide what a standard of value is worth, not how much there is.*

***Evict*** measured money, NOT TENANTS (not VALUE!).
***Foreclose*** against measured money, NOT AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OWN HOUSES (not against VALUE!).

* ### ***VALUE IN EXCHANGE is the FOREMOST HOME SECURITY SYSTEM,*** is specialization value, value originating in and destined for homes, thus ***<ins>LOWERING HOME COST AND RAISING HOME VALUE</ins>.*** By contrast, vanished civilizations are monuments to interference with housing, to ***<ins>RAISING HOUSE COST AND LOWERING HOUSE VALUE - A HOUSE OF CARDS!!! (THE HIGH COST OF SLAVE LABOR)</ins>.*** Only slaves would live in a house of cards, ***<ins>but the palaces the slave drivers lived in turned out to be the same</ins> ...***

* # ***Land ownership***

  ## Land is no product of human labor, ***LAND OWNERSHIP CAN ONLY BE BY MUTUAL CONSENT, BY THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF IT IMPLICIT IN <ins>HUMAN NATURE, EXCHANGING THINGS</ins>,*** the human capability which separates humans from the jungle. ***WITHOUT A <ins>SAFE HAVEN, A HOME!!!!!</ins>, FOR GOODS EXCHANGED, THERE COULD BE NO EXCHANGES, ONLY THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE.***<br>

***<br>High house value is***<br>
> ***<ins>LIVING IN ONE!!!!!</ins> - ASK ANY HOMELESS PERSON.***<br>

## ***Real stimulus***<br> 
 **is measuring length and weight, not inches, ounces, or dollars. Measuring DEFINED inches, ounces, or dollars is impossible, they invariably serve their default purpose of measurement. Announcing UNDEFINED inches, ounces, and dollars would immediately fail. So, UNDEFINED DOLLARS, DOLLARS WITH NO ID, AREN'T ANNOUNCED, THEY'RE SAID TO BE MEASURED. Distorting value, conferring undeserved value, is all that measured money (dollars with no ID) does. Without measured money, the distorted value of housing would end, EVICTIONS, FORECLOSURES, AND HOMELESS PEOPLE COULD NEVER BE ISSUES. The gold standard is no issue of the amount of money, it's the issue of ENDING DISTORTED VALUES.**

## ***Real stimulus***<br> 
 **is the whole idea of a money economy,** its great advantage over the primitive condition of financial complexity (barter economy), MEASURING VALUE, NOT THE HOAX (FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY) OF MEASURING A STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT.<br><br>***Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*** means no access to standards of measurement? ***Inalienable rights*** require an ID? ***A photo ID*** to use an ***UNDEFINED INCH OR OUNCE (INCH OR OUNCE WITHOUT AN ID)? A photo ID*** to make measurements? ***Gold dollars attract a zillion times more private property (VALUE) to market, a zillion times more VALUE to measure, a zillion times more scrutiny of the dollar (money trail). HOUSES STAY HOME!!!, houses and their occupants are safe!!!***<br><br>GOLD DOLLARS ARE FOR REWARDING PEOPLE, NOT FOR DISRUPTING PEOPLE, NOT FOR WASTING RESOURCES, NOT FOR SQUANDERING ON HOUSES!!!***<br><br>Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness means disrupt housing?<br>

# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR***
***Without an ID, the DOLLAR IS HOMELESS, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. DISTORTED VALUE IS HOMELESS!, houses and their occupants are NO LONGER SAFE! HOMELESS HOUSES AND HOMELESS PEOPLE!!! Distorted value, HOMELESS DOLLARS, CAUSES HOMELESS HOUSES AND HOMELESS PEOPLE!!!***

# ***<br>THE HOMELESS DOLLAR. Part 2***<br>
## ***Without an ID, the dollar is homeless, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. Nor as measured money either. The measuring of money is conducted entirely as a very deep subject which even the experts can never agree upon. PRICE HAGGLING AT ITS WORST!!!, NO AGREEMENT EVER REACHED!!! The Federal Reserve has never even duplicated BUYING GROCERIES WITH A COW!, where at least a real transaction takes place. BUYING AND SELLING can't work for dollars with no ID, for measuring money. People and houses are safe, no turmoil, no distractions, nowhere for ID-less dollars to hide. BORROWING AND LENDING, and CHARITY, is the only way, transactions abandoned, replaced with distracted captive audiences, only an endless quest for accomplices, for more people to pass the buck to.***<br><br>

### ***Gold and silver are never homeless, everyone will take personal responsibility for them, never change the amount of money in the world or otherwise change the subject or defy the dictionary, always measure THE SAFETY OF HOUSES, the safer the house the more SPECIALIZATION (VALUE) takes place, the more private property (VALUE) comes to market.

## ***THE HOMELESS (PHOTO ID-POWERED) DOLLAR. Part 6. No substitute for PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY-POWERED dollars.***<br>
***All the money measurers have photo IDs, none will take personal responsibility for what they do, issuing ID-less dollars. Only 
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY (VALUE!!!) circulates gold dollars, not photo IDs. Measure personal responsibility (VALUE!!!, HOUSE SAFETY!!!), not money.***

## ***THE HOMELESS (WITHOUT NATURAL LAW) DOLLAR. Part 7. LAWS AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A HOME*** 

### ***The judicial branch of government stands for NATURAL LAW (law with a home; personal responsibility, private property), as opposed to man-made law, which may, as with money measuring laws, be HOMELESS, DEFY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PRIVATE PROPERTY. But the judicial branch STANDS FOR NOTHING when it STANDS SILENT, as with the money measuring laws.***

Money needed for housing cost can't circulate, will only leave home after house cost has been paid, WHEN HOUSING IS AFFORDABLE!!! The homeless dollar doesn't move, stagnates building up debt instead of ownership, bogus instead of affordable prices, avoiding instead of addressing human needs.***

This drove up prices and made foreign trade almost impossible, as foreigners would not take the worthless coins ... Common action was called for to¬† put things right; but each state - the Poles, the Prussians, the Order, and even each big city, such as Torun and Danzig - clung jealously to its own right to coin it's own money. Attempts to get agreement had always broken down.<br><br>Copernicus ... was all in favor of a *monetary union* of all the states concerned: they should all agree to have the same coins; ... each coin was to contain a guaranteed weight of precious metal ...<br>(Copernicus seems to have drawn up some notes ... in 1519.

They'd been hit by hard times, their answer was the** ***Farm Holiday movement.***<br><br>Whenever the news was out that a farm was about to be foreclosed by a mortgage company, that the sheriff was to come and put his red flag in the yard and conduct an auction, all the neighbors from miles and miles around would get there early. They'd come with their daughters and wives and box lunches and sit in the yard and when the sheriff started the auction they'd bid: one cent for a tractor; two cents for twelve acres; four cents for the entire house and barn and outbuildings; perhaps fifty cents for the whole farm.<br><br>And they made sure that nobody else would bid on their neighbor's farm. No bank man or lawyer or city fellow would so much as bid a cent without finding two or three husky farm lads around him ready to throw him in the pond and chase him back to the city he'd come from.<br><br>Even the sheriff and his deputies walked softly and spoke carefully when they saw the husky farm lads around in the dusty depression year of 1933 in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Kansas.<br><br>The neighbors would buy the farm from the auctioneer for fifty cents or so and then turn around and give it back to the rightful owners: the people who farmed the land and sweated in the sun and froze in the winter and broke their backs to bring in a crop of corn or oats or rye or wheat.<br>...<br><br>The year 1933 was a bad one for banks and mortgage companies that tried to drive farmers off the land out in the prairie states."**x<br>

You will find there all I have to give you.'¬† They thought there was a treasure buried somewhere in the vineyard, and after their father was dead they dug ***every INCH*** of the soil.
