#<span style="">measurevaluenotmoney

Measure length, not inches. Measure weight, not ounces.

By definition, no one ever changed the amount of money in the world, people decide what a standard of value is worth, not how much there is.

Evict measured money, NOT TENANTS (not VALUE!).
Foreclose against measured money, NOT AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OWN HOUSES (not against VALUE!).
