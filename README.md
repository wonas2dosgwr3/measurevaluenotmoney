###### Measure length, not inches. Measure weight, not ounces.

* *The primitive condition of mankind is FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY (BARTER ECONOMY).*

* *By definition, no one ever changed the amount of money in the world, people decide what a standard of value is worth, not how much there is.*

***Evict*** measured money, NOT TENANTS (not VALUE!).

***Foreclose*** against measured money, NOT AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OWN HOUSES (not against VALUE!).


#  ***Real stimulus***

 is measuring length and weight, not inches, ounces, or dollars. ***Measuring DEFINED inches, ounces, or dollars is impossible,*** they invariably serve their default purpose of measurement. ***Announcing UNDEFINED inches, ounces, and dollars would immediately fail.*** So, ***UNDEFINED DOLLARS, DOLLARS WITH NO ID, AREN'T ANNOUNCED, THEY'RE SAID TO BE MEASURED.***



***Distorting value, conferring undeserved value, is all that measured money (dollars with no ID) does.***



Without measured money, ***the distorted value of housing would end, EVICTIONS, FORECLOSURES, AND HOMELESS PEOPLE COULD NEVER BE ISSUES.***



The gold standard is ***no issue of the amount of money, it's the issue of ENDING DISTORTED VALUES.***



***Real stimulus is the whole idea of a money economy,*** its great advantage over the primitive condition of financial complexity (barter economy), ***MEASURING VALUE, NOT THE HOAX (FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY) OF MEASURING A STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT.***



> ***Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*** means no access to standards of measurement? ***Inalienable rights*** require an ID? A photo ID to use an ***UNDEFINED INCH OR OUNCE (INCH OR OUNCE WITHOUT AN ID)?*** A photo ID to make measurements?  ***Gold dollars attract a zillion times more private property (VALUE) to market, a zillion times more VALUE to measure, a zillion times more scrutiny of the dollar (money trail). HOUSES STAY HOME!!!, houses and their occupants are safe!!!***

> ***GOLD DOLLARS ARE FOR REWARDING PEOPLE, NOT FOR DISRUPTING PEOPLE, NOT FOR WASTING RESOURCES, NOT FOR SQUANDERING ON HOUSES!!!*** 

> ***Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness*** means disrupt housing?

* *By definition, no one ever changed the amount of money in the world, people decide what a MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE is worth, not how much there is.*


# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR***

***Without an ID, the DOLLAR IS HOMELESS, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. DISTORTED VALUE IS HOMELESS!, houses and their occupants are NO LONGER SAFE!
 HOMELESS HOUSES AND HOMELESS PEOPLE!!!***

***Distorted value, HOMELESS DOLLARS, CAUSES HOMELESS HOUSES AND HOMELESS PEOPLE!!!***

* *Real stimulus is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.*

# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR. Part 2***

Without an ID, the dollar is homeless, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. ***Nor as measured money either. The measuring of money is conducted entirely as a very deep subject which even the experts can never agree upon. PRICE HAGGLING AT ITS WORST!!!, NO AGREEMENT EVER REACHED!!! The Federal Reserve has never even duplicated BUYING GROCERIES WITH A COW!, where at least a real transaction takes place. BUYING AND SELLING can't work for dollars with no ID, for measuring money. People and houses are safe, no turmoil, no distractions, nowhere for ID-less dollars to hide. BORROWING AND LENDING, and CHARITY, is the only way, transactions abandoned, replaced with distracted captive audiences, only an endless quest for accomplices, for more people to pass the buck to.***

# ***LA MONEDA NUEVA***

***An ordinary fellow with some first-hand knowledge of Argentina's "Moneda Nueva" once had something like this to say about it: "When the "Moneda Nueva" comes out, they change the number of zeroes and move the decimal point around."***

# ***THE HOMELESS DOLLAR. Part 3***

Without an ID, the dollar is <ins>***homeless, no one will take personal responsibility for it as such. Nor as measured money either.</ins> The measuring of money is conducted entirely as a <ins>CONSPIRACY!!!</ins>***


## Measuring value is ***<ins>MEASURING HUMAN LABOR</ins>, nothing can be more important, no product of human labor, <ins>NO HOUSE</ins> can be more important, LET ALONE <ins>LAND, NO PRODUCT OF HUMAN LABOR AT  ALL. Measuring value, houses naturally fall into place BEHIND people, are their servants and creations, not their oppressors.</ins>***
