## <br>***Real stimulus***<br> 
 **is measuring length and weight, not inches, ounces, or dollars. Measuring DEFINED inches, ounces, or dollars is impossible, they invariably serve their default purpose of measurement. Announcing UNDEFINED inches, ounces, and dollars would immediately fail. So, UNDEFINED DOLLARS, DOLLARS WITH NO ID, AREN'T ANNOUNCED, THEY'RE SAID TO BE MEASURED. Distorting value, conferring undeserved value, is all that measured money (dollars with no ID) does. Without measured money, the distorted value of housing would end, EVICTIONS, FORECLOSURES, AND HOMELESS PEOPLE COULD NEVER BE ISSUES. The gold standard is no issue of the amount of money, it's the issue of ENDING DISTORTED VALUES.**

This drove up prices and made foreign trade almost impossible, as foreigners would not take the worthless coins ... Common action was called for to  put things right; but each state - the Poles, the Prussians, the Order, and even each big city, such as Torun and Danzig - clung jealously to its own right to coin it's own money.

### ***If prices were legitimate (accurate measurements), the marketplace would be inundated with private property, a rising standard of living.***<br> 
Abnormal prices (inaccurate measurements) advertise danger, some people more equal than others, a place to avoid, the influence of non-industrious people, people looking for spoils (plunder), not a place for everyone. Abnormal behaviour. No one will take personal responsibility for the abnormal dollar.

>> #### ***Son voisin, au contraire, étant tout cousu d'or, chantait peu, dormait moins encor: c'était un homme de finance. ... ... En son hôtel il fait venir le chantier, et lui dit: 《Ah çà, sire Grégoire, <ins>que gagnez-vous par an?</ins>***<br><br>***Par an, moi foi, monsieur, dit avec un ton de rieur le gaillard savetier, ce n'est point ma manière de compter de la sorte, et je n'entasse guère un jour sur l'autre: il suffit qu'à la fin j'att zee rape le bout de l'année; chaque jour amène son pain.***<br><br>***- Eh bien! <ins>que gagnez-vous, dites-moi, par journée?</ins>***<br><br>***Tantôt plus, tantôt moins: le mal est que toujours ... le mal est que dans l'an s'entremêlent des jours qu'il faut chômer; on nous ruine en fêtes; l'une fait tort à l'autre, et monsieur le curé de quelque nouveau saint charge toujours son prône.》***<br><br>***Le Financier, riant de sa naïveté, lui dit: <ins>《Je veux vous mettre aujourd'hui sur le trône: Prenez ces cent écus, gardez-les avec soin, pour vous en servir au besoin.</ins>***<br><br>***Le Savetier crut voir tout l'argent que la terre avait, depuis plus de cent ans, produit pour l'usage des gens. Il retourne chez lui; dans sa cave il enserre l'argent, et sa joie à la fois. Plus de chant: il perdit la voix du moment qu'il gagna ce qui cause nos peínes. Le sommeil quitta son logis; il eut pour hôtes les soucis les soupçons, les alarmes vaines. Tout le jour il avait l'oeil au guet; et la nuit, si quelque chat faisait du bruit, le chat prenait l'argent. A la fin, le pauvre homme s'encourut chez celui qu'il ne réveillait plus:***<br><br>***<ins>《Rendez-moi, lui dit-il, mes chansons et mon somme, et reprenez vos cent écus.》</ins>***
